# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

My initial experience with python was in sophmore year in media computation. the only other coding language I have used is godot, which was used in a video game engine, but I find python easier to understand.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I made use of the function in claude that allows you to highlight text and ask for further clarification in order to define only wha I needed to define and not give away the whole answer.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

I had trouble with loops, becuase I have not used them in a year, but the AI gave me and example to clarify how their syntax worked.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

Asking for definitions with certain specific things instead of just asking for the answer allows you to use AI as a learning guide and not an answer machine.
